# Twitter User Details Bot

## Overview

This project is a Twitter bot developed in Python that can retrieve basic details from any Twitter user account. It utilizes the Twitter API to gather information such as the user's name, bio, location, follower count, and more. This README file provides instructions on how to set up and use the bot.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this Twitter bot, you need to have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Twitter Developer Account**: You must have a Twitter Developer account and create a Twitter App. This is necessary to obtain the API keys and access tokens required for making API requests. You can create a Twitter Developer account at [https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).

2. **Python 3**: Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

3. **Tweepy Library**: You need to install the Tweepy library, which simplifies Twitter API access. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install tweepy
   ```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-user-details-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd twitter-user-details-bot
   ```

3. Open the `config.py` file and add your Twitter API credentials:

   ```python
   CONSUMER_KEY = 'your_consumer_key'
   CONSUMER_SECRET = 'your_consumer_secret'
   ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token'
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your_access_token_secret'
   ```

4. Save the changes to `config.py`.

## Usage

To use the Twitter User Details Bot, follow these steps:

1. Run the bot by executing the `main.py` file:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to enter the Twitter username of the user whose details you want to fetch.

3. The bot will make an API request to Twitter, retrieve the user's details, and display them in the console.

## Example Output

Here's an example of what the bot's output might look like:

```
Enter the Twitter username: example_user
User Details for @example_user:
Name: John Doe
Bio: Tech enthusiast | Developer | Explorer
Location: San Francisco, CA
Followers Count: 1000
Following Count: 500
Joined Twitter: April 2015
```
